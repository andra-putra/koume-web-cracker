# WiFi Handshake Cracker Web Interface

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a web-based interface for uploading, storing, sharing, searching, and attempting to crack WiFi handshakes. The goal is to simplify the process of handling WiFi handshakes and integrate tools like hashcat for cracking, all within a secure and user-friendly environment.

## Goals
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for managing WiFi handshakes.
- Automate the process of uploading and storing handshake files.
- Enable secure access to the website with authentication.
- Integrate hashcat for cracking handshakes with options for dictionary attacks, masking, and using known wordlists.
- Ensure the security of the stored data and the integrity of the process.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or Django)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 for storing handshake files
- **Processing:** Local gaming PC and Raspberry Pi for running hashcat, potential cloud integration
- **Hosting:** AWS EC2 for hosting the web application, AWS RDS for database management
- **Version Control and Collaboration:** GitHub

## Collaboration Tools
- GitHub for code sharing, version control, and collaboration.
- Project management tools (Trello or GitHub Projects) for task tracking.

## Security Considerations
- Implement secure login mechanisms.
- Ensure the protection of data in transit and at rest.
